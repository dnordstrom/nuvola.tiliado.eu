Problems with Third-Party Builds
--------------------------------

Unfortunately, Nuvola Project does not have enough neither human nor financial resources to support third-party builds
free of charge. Investigation of issues of these build is often tedious and very demanding as Nuvola Project does not
have these builds under control and cannot guarantee that they have been built properly and use a complete set of
correct runtime dependencies.
