Nuvola Player Terms
===================

Version 2 
---------

These terms are **effective from April 11th, 2021**.

1. Nuvola Player is an open-source project.
   You can [download the entire source code](https://github.com/tiliado/nuvolaplayer) for free under
   the [BSD-2-Clause license](https://github.com/tiliado/nuvolaplayer/blob/master/LICENSE).
   In particular, you may study it, modify it, build Nuvola for you, or even distribute it further.
   However, third-party builds should not give the impression that they are provided or supported by
   the Nuvola Player project.

2. Nuvola Player is not affiliated with any service provider.
   We cannot guarantee that Nuvola will stay compatible with a particular streaming service.
   If there is no feasible solution to the problem, incompatible services are marked as deprecated
   and the decision is explained.
   Deprecated services may be removed at any time.

3. Users of the official flatpak builds of Nuvola Player installed from the
   [Nuvola Player Repository](/index/) are eligible for user support free of charge,
   providing they follow [Get Help instructions](/help/).
   We may refuse to provide support or require a fee in other cases.

4. The official flatpak builds of Nuvola Player require [a purchase of a license key](/pricing/)
   to unlock some features when a free trial period ends.
   Users may not share license keys with third parties.
   License keys with a high number of activations may be revoked without any refund.

5. Users who purchased a license key may [ask for a refund](mailto:support@tiliado.eu) if they are
   not satisfied with Nuvola Player or the streaming service they use has become incompatible.
   Each refund request is assessed individually.
   We do not refund expired or revoked licenses.
   In some cases, a [PayPal account](https://www.paypal.com/) is required to receive a refund.

6. By using Nuvola, you agree with [Tiliado Privacy Policy](https://tiliado.eu/privacy/).

* Nuvola Player is an open-source project.
  You can download the entire source code for free under the BSD-2-Clause license.
  Feel free to study it, modify it, build Nuvola for you, or even distribute it further.
  
* The official flatpak builds of Nuvola require a purchase to unlock some features when a free trial
  period ends. We ask users for the payment to cover the project's expenses and to provide them with
  support beyond the usual open-source standard. It also motivates us to focus on quality and to
  develop Nuvola further even though some obstacles may seem too demanding. By purchasing Nuvola,
  you tell us: "Don't give up, we appreciate your work."
  
* By using Nuvola, you agree with Tiliado Privacy Policy. The short version is: 
  We collect only the data we need to provide you with our services. We don't sell your personal
  information. If you have any questions, feedback or a data removal request, don't hesitate to
  contact support.
