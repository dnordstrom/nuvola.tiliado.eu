<h2>Is it possible to get Nuvola for free?</h2>
<p>
  Yes, it is. Nuvola Apps is an open-source project. We make the entire source code available on GitHub for free.
  You can download it, study it, modify it, build Nuvola for you, or even distribute it further. There are also
  some third-party builds of Nuvola you can install right away. However, these builds come with no support from Nuvola
  Apps project.
</p>
<p>
  The official flatpak builds of Nuvola, our flagship product, contain free features as well as paid ones. If you wish
  to use the latter, you need to purchase a license. Alternatively, you can participate in the Nuvola Apps project to
  get a free developer license.
</p>

<h2>Why are the official builds of Nuvola paid?</h2>
<p>
  Firstly, the Nuvola project needs to pay for its real expenses. The Tiliado.eu domain, hosting of the Nuvola website
  and the Flatpak repository, a VPN service to support geographically restricted streaming services, a grammar checker
  to improve texts in release announcements and the documentation. Moreover, some streaming services don't have a free
  plan, so we need to purchase a paid plan to maintain their integration scripts and fix bugs.
</p>
<p>
  Secondly, it motivates us to focus on quality and to continue working on the project further even though it may
  sometimes be too demanding or frustrating. Nuvola is an example of small projects (one core developer and three script
  maintainers) which tend to disappear when the primary developer losses interest and moves on to improve skills in
  different areas. If it weren't for the fantastic users who value Nuvola so much that they purchased it, Nuvola would
  have already been retired.
</p>
<p>
  We also explored the option to make Nuvola available for free while asking for donations, but it didn't work well
  enough. We want to provide you with a product worth paying for rather than to beg for donations.
